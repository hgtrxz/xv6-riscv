// 1.Look at some other programs in user/ (e.g., user/echo.c, user/grep.c, and user/rm.c)
//   to see how you can obtain the command-line arguments passed to a program.
//
// 2.The command-line argument is passed as a string; you can convert it to an integer using atoi (see user/ulib.c).
//
// 3.See kernel/sysproc.c for the xv6 kernel code that implements the sleep system call (look for sys_sleep),
//   user/user.h for the C definition of sleep callable from a user program,
//   and user/usys.S for the assembler code that jumps from user code into the kernel for sleep.
//
// 4.Make sure main calls exit() in order to exit your program.
//
// 5.Add your sleep program to UPROGS in Makefile; once you've done that,
//   make qemu will compile your program, and you'll be able to run it from the xv6 shell.
